# I hate XML
#
# Over engineered piece of crap. To complicated, to verbose syntax,
# horrible to write, not really humand readable. Too much stuff. Schemas,
# Xpath?
#
# Schemas: Just use JSON and use the type-system Sq::Type for "Schemas".
#
# XPath:   how crappy is your language support for querying and working
#          with data that you need another "language" to query/transform
#          data?
#
# So i don't know if i will ever support that stuff. Please stop
# using XML.
