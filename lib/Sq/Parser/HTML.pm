# Really an HTML Parser?
#
# At least not one that is "forgiving" as many HTML Parsers for web
# browsers that still can show stuff and ignores errors. But HTML
# is anyway much like XML. Also don't really know if something like that
# needs to be part of the default Sq distribution.
#
# Generating HTML on the other hand is something different. After years
# of coding i think the typical "template" based stuff is not good.
# Why create a TEMPLATE PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE that supports all kinds
# of data looping, filtering and so on when you have a programming language
# at hand?
