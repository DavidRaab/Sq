# INSTALLATION

Installation is simple.

    perl Build.PL
    ./Build
    ./Build test
    ./Build install

You obviously should only install when all tests succedded.

For Sq to properly work you should have installed following modules.

Last Update: 2025-11-25

* Text::CSV
* Path::Tiny
* JSON

Sq will start without them, but then not all functionality will be available.
But if a module is missing you will get a runtime exception telling you.
